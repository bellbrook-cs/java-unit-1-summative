# Unit 1 Summative Lab

## Problem Statement

You have the full period to complete the following assignment, this is meant to be a summative lab and you cannot get help from peers. You may ask an instructor questions about what the expectations are, however they will not answer any questions about how to to do something. You are allowed to access notes, and the textbook as needed.

You must write a program that meets the following requirements.

You must use remarks/comments to label your solution to each task below.

1. Use 1 line of code to print `"Part 1"` to the console.
2. Uses 1 line of code to declare 3 variables of type `String`.
3. On seperate lines, initialize the 3 variables you just declared to have 3 different Strings in them.
  - The Strings should all be at least `3` characters long.
  - The Strings should all be different lengths.
4. Add code to your program that will display all 3 Strings on the same line.
  - You may not use any String literals to do this.
5. Declare and initialize 3 variables that will hold the length of each string.
  - You should use the most appropriate variable type.
6. Declare a variable named `average` of type `double`. Do not initialize it.
7. On a seperate line, use the assignment operator to set average to the average length of the 3 Strings from step 2.
8. Display the average length of the strings to the screen.
  - You should display the exact value of the average, including any decimal.
  - You should display some text explaining what the number is like this:
  - `The average length of the 3 strings is: 5.0`
9. Use 1 line of code to print "Part 2" to the console.
10. Declare 3 ints named shortBase, longBase, and height. Assign different non-negative values to them.
11. Assuming the variables shortBase, longBase, and height describe the properties of a trapezoid. Display the area of the trapezoid.
  - You should display the exact area, including any decimals.
  - You should display some text that describes the number like this:
  - `The area of the trapezoid is: 4.0`
12. Declare a variable named `sum` of type `int`. Initialize it to have a value of 0.
13. Use compound assignment operators to find the sum of the length of all Strings from step 2.
  - You should be using the same compound assignment operator 3 times, on 3 different lines.
14. Display the value of the variable sum in the console.
  - You should display some text that describes the number like this:
  - `The value of sum is: 12`
15. Use 1 line of code to display your name on it's own line.

## Input Description

I should be able to modify the values you initialized in step 3 and step 10. After making these changes the output of your program should adjust automatically.

## Sample Input/Output

If I set the value of the 3 strings to the following:

- "Hello John"
- "Hello World"
- "Hey World"

And I set shortBase, longBase, and height to the following:

- shortBase: 10
- longBase: 11
- height: 5

An example output would be:

```
Part 1
The average length of the 3 strings is 10.0
Part 2
The area of the trapezoid is: 52.5
The value of sum is: 30
